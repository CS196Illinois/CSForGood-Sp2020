For this project we are going for an autograder and teacher for handwriting. Primarily meant for children that might not have enough time with a human teacher. This would help give the opportunity of education for those, in the issue of not having enough teachers for students. We will be using Optical Character Recognition with tesseract and TTS for feedback. Mainly using raspberry pi as the hardware.
